#Project: Finance Simulation

Client: A beginner investor who wants to learn about the stock market and practice trading skills.

Goal: To create a web app that allows the user to manage portfolios of stocks, check real-time prices and values, and simulate buying and selling transactions.

Contribution: I developed the web app using Django, a Python web framework, and SQLite3, a lightweight database engine. I used FontAwesome and Bootstrap to enhance the user interface and make it responsive and attractive. I implemented features such as:

1- Creating and deleting portfolios
2- Adding and removing stocks from portfolios
3- Displaying the current price, change, and value of each stock and portfolio
4- Fetching real-time data from a third-party API
5- Simulating buying and selling stocks with a virtual cash balance.
6- Validating user inputs and handling errors

Success: The web app met the clientâ€™s expectations and requirements. It provided a user-friendly and interactive way to learn about the stock market and practice trading skills. The web app was tested and deployed on a web server and received positive feedback from the client and other users. The web app demonstrated my skills and knowledge in web development, database management, and financial data analysis.
